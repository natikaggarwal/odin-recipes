Recipe Page - Create a recipe page to showcase basic HTML
This is my first project with The Odin Project cirriculum. I learned how to use boilerplate HTML, creating directories, navigating through different files in the command line, staging, pushing and commiting changes to GitHub. In addition, I used ordered and unordered lists for displaying information in a readable manner.
